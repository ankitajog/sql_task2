firstly create a new database or existing database can be used to create a table
Here I created a table with Constraints such primary key i.e unique values are assigned to emp_id column and not null constraints to emp_name and emp_position which will never take null values at all .Also default constraint to work_hour column.
Then inserted rows using 'insert into' query .
Also 105 emp_id is used to add values on selected columns .so here working hour is added automatically due to default constraint.
Also applied update and delete query to manipulate data.
lastly, deleted the whole records but not deleted structure.
To delete structure use: drop database db_name
